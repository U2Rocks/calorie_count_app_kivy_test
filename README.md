# calorie_count_app_kivy_test
a test build for a kivy(python) app that allows someone to check the calorie count of mcdonalds meals

This app is not fully functional, but a quick prototype to test a idea. The app currently crashes when you add too much stuff to the calorie list and try to delete things.
